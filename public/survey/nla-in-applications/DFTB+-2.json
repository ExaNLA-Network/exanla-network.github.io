Excited state requires the ground state solution first at each geometry (see relevant survey entry), but the time dominate step on this code path is the excited solution stage. At the moment we have two different sub-code paths within the excited state path, the pARPACK route will probably eventually fully replace the other code path (the second is required for hybrid density-functionals as the matrices are non-symmetric in that case). I will therefore describe the ARPACK route.",
