Mathematical operation is equivalent to a least squares solution, A X = B, with a very poor condition number for A. But this approach uses the nature of the differential equations and their boundary conditions to write well conditioned equations on the interface between two sub-spaces of the system (and then evaluates principal angles and principal modes).",
